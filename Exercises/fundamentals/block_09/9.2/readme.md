### Application Programming Interface (API)

An **API** allows applications to communicate with each other, serving as a "bridge" for them. An API is not a database or a server, but the one responsible for controlling access points to them, through a set of routines and programming standards

> Every API is a backend, but not every backend is an API.

A standard website backend returns templates for the front end of a single application, through defined routes. For example, when you access a page on our platform, you are making a **request** to the server, which returns a template as a **response**.

The APIs also have access routes that allow communication with the server, but they do not need to return templates. Generally, they return data in **JSON** format.
