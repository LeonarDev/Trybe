# (5.2) JavaScript - Working with Elements

### The purpose of these exercises is to put into practice what you have just learned about DOM. Therefore, you should do the exercises using only JavaScript code

- [x] 1. Add the h1 tag with the text Exercise 5.2 - JavaScript DOM as a child of the body tag;

- [x] 2. Add the div tag with the main-content class as a child of the body tag;

- [x] 3. Add the div tag with the center-content class as a child of the div tag created in step 2;

- [x] 4. Add the tag p as a child of the div created in step 3 and add some text;

- [x] 5. Add the div tag with the left-content class as a child of the div tag created in step 2;

- [x] 6. Add the div tag with the right-content class as a child of the div tag created in step 2;

- [x] 7. Add an image with src set to https://picsum.photos/200 and small-image class. This element must be a child of the div created in step 5;

- [x] 8. Add an unordered list with values from 1 to 10 in full as list values. This list must be a child of the div created in step 6;

- [x] 9. Add 3 h3 tags, all children of the div created in step 2.

### Now that you've created a lot, let's make some changes and removals:

- [x] 10. Add the title class to the created h1 tag;

- [x] 11. Add the description class in the 3 h3 tags created;

- [x] 12. Remove the div created in step 5 (the one with the left-content class). Use the .removeChild () function;

- [x] 13. Center the div created in step 6 (the one that has the right-content class). Tip: to centralize, just configure margin-right: auto do div;

- [x] 14. Change the background color of the parent element of the div created in step 3 (the one that has the center-content class) to green;

- [x] 15. Remove the last two elements (nine and ten) from the list created in step 8.
