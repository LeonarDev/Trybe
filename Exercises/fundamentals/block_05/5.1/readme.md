`Window`: Represents a window that contains a DOM element, being possible to access the document that the window contains through Window;

`location`: Represents the location of the object to which it is associated, that is, the current document;

`document`: Represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point for the content on the web page, so the document contains all HTML documents;

`history`: Allows the manipulation of the browser session history, that is, the pages visited on the tab or frame where the current page is loaded;

`element`: It is the most general base class from which all objects in a Document inherit, that is, they are all tags that are in HTML files and become elements of the DOM tree;

`text`: Text that goes between the elements, is the entire content of the tags;

`attribute`: These are all the attributes that a specific node has, such as a class or id.
