# (4.2) JavaScript - Array and loop For

You will use this array in the exercises:
```js
let numbers = [5, 9, 3, 19, 70, 8, 100, 2, 35, 27];
```


1. In this first exercise, scroll through the array by printing all the values contained in it with the function console.log();

2. For the second exercise, you must add all the values contained in the array and print the result;

3. For the third exercise, calculate and print the arithmetic mean of the values contained in the array;
- The arithmetic mean is the result of the sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements.

4. Using the same code as in the previous exercise, if the final value is greater than 20, print the message: "value greater than 20". If not, print the message: "value less than or equal to 20";

5. Using for, find out what is the largest value contained in the array and print it;

6. Find out how many odd values are in the array and print the result. If none exist, print the message: "no odd values found";

7. Using for, find out the lowest value contained in the array and print it;

8. Using for, create an array that goes from 1 to 25 and print the result;

9. Using the array created in the previous exercise, print the result of dividing each of the elements by 2.
